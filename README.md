Amazon.com-Employee-Access-Challenge
====================================
##Predict an employee's access needs, given his/her job role

When an employee at any company starts work, they first need to obtain the computer access necessary to fulfill their role. This access may allow an employee to read/manipulate resources through various applications or web portals. It is assumed that employees fulfilling the functions of a given role will access the same or similar resources. It is often the case that employees figure out the access they need as they encounter roadblocks during their daily work (e.g. not able to log into a reporting portal). A knowledgeable supervisor then takes time to manually grant the needed access in order to overcome access obstacles. As employees move throughout a company, this access discovery/recovery cycle wastes a nontrivial amount of time and money.

There is a considerable amount of data regarding an employeeâ€™s role within an organization and the resources to which they have access. Given the data related to current employees and their provisioned access, models can be built that automatically determine access privileges as employees enter and leave roles within a company. These auto-access models seek to minimize the human involvement required to grant or revoke employee access.

###Objective
The objective of this competition is to build a model, learned using historical data, that will determine an employee's access needs, such that manual access transactions (grants and revokes) are minimized as the employee's attributes change over time. The model will take an employee's role information and a resource code and will return whether or not access should be granted.

The data consists of real historical data collected from 2010 & 2011.  Employees are manually allowed or denied access to resources over time. You must create an algorithm capable of learning from this historical data to predict approval/denial for an unseen set of employees. 

####File Descriptions
train.csv - The training set. Each row has the ACTION (ground truth), RESOURCE, and information about the employee's role at the time of approval

test.csv - The test set for which predictions should be made.  Each row asks whether an employee having the listed characteristics should have access to the listed resource.

###Column Descriptions

 **Column Name**	                                **Description**
  
ACTION (target variable)         	ACTION is 1 if the resource was approved, 0 if the resource was not

RESOURCE                         	An ID for each resource

MGR_ID                           	The EMPLOYEE ID of the manager of the current EMPLOYEE ID record; an employee may have only                                   one manager at a time

ROLE_ROLLUP_1	                    Company role grouping category id 1 (e.g. US Engineering)

ROLE_ROLLUP_2                   	Company role grouping category id 2 (e.g. US Retail)

ROLE_DEPTNAME                   	Company role department description (e.g. Retail)

ROLE_TITLE                      	Company role business title description (e.g. Senior Engineering Retail Manager)

ROLE_FAMILY_DESC                	Company role family extended description (e.g. Retail Manager, Software Engineering)

ROLE_FAMILY                     	Company role family description (e.g. Retail Manager)

ROLE_CODE                       	Company role code; this code is unique to each role (e.g. Manager)

**Note:** The training data set has 32770 rows and the test data set has 58922 rows.
